### **3. Advanced Quantum-Era Exploits (2030-2035)**

#### **Cross-Chain Quantum Arbitrage**
- **Attack Vector**: Different chains migrating to quantum resistance at different speeds
- **Exploit Mechanism**: Exploit quantum-vulnerable chains while others remain secure
- **Example Scenario**: Attacker breaks Bitcoin signatures to steal BTC, converts to quantum-safe assets on Ethereum
- **Bounty Potential**: $2M-$10M (cross-chain systemic risk)

#### **Quantum Front-Running**
- **Attack Vector**: Real-time ECDSA breaking for transaction manipulation
- **Exploit Mechanism**: Break pending transaction signatures, submit competing transactions
- **Example Scenario**: Quantum computer breaks DeFi transaction signatures in mempool, enabling MEV extraction at unprecedented scale
- **Bounty Potential**: $1M-$5M (new attack class)

## ðŸ”¬ **Research Methodology for Quantum Exploits**

### **Phase 1: Implementation Analysis (2025-2027)**
```python

        ml_dsa_issues = self.analyze_ml_dsa_validation()
        
        # Check for hybrid crypto logic flaws
        hybrid_issues = self.analyze_hybrid_cryptography()
        
        return vulnerabilities
    
    def analyze_migration_protocols(self):
        """Analyze quantum migration protocol vulnerabilities"""
        # Bitcoin P2QRH analysis
