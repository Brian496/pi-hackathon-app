# Governance/Bridge Risk Heuristics

This scanner augments detection with governance/bridge surface checks. It flags contracts whose bytecode contains sensitive function selectors commonly used for administrative control, upgradeability, and bridge mint/burn flows.

Selectors scanned (4-byte):
- grantRole(bytes32,address): `0x2f2ff15d`
- setRoleAdmin(bytes32,bytes32): `0xa547a06e`
- transferOwnership(address): `0xf2fde38b`
- upgradeTo(address): `0x3659cfe6`
- upgradeToAndCall(address,bytes): `0x4f1ef286`
- mint(address,uint256): `0x40c10f19`
- mint(uint256): `0x18160ddd`
- burn(uint256): `0x42966c68`
- burnFrom(address,uint256): `0x79cc6790`
- finalizeInbound(bytes): `0x1f1c7c70`
- pause(): `0x8456cb59`
- unpause(): `0x3f4ba83a`

Notes:
- This is heuristic and ABI-less; findings indicate surface exposure, not necessarily exploitability. Validate with ABIs and role restrictions.
- For bridges, verify mint/burn authorization model, quotas/rate limits, and multi-party confirmations.
- For governance, verify timelocks, guardian/pauser roles, and multisig thresholds.

### Sonic-specific patterns (Numa context)
- Monitor contracts exposing Compound-style liquidation flows (`liquidateBorrow`) combined with internal synthetic mint modules (e.g., `NumaPrinter`) without oracle-backed pricing
- Flag sudden increases in synthetic liabilities (nuAssets) that can programmatically depress cToken exchange rates used as collateral
# Scanner/Monitoring Rules â€” Governance & Bridge Hardening

## Detection (Static / On-Chain)
- RoleGranted/OwnershipTransferred without prior timelock event/window
- ACL addRole/setRoleAdmin callable by EOA owner; no multi-party consent
- Bridge mint/burn callable by single role; no caps/limits
- Lending borrow where collateral token totalSupply increases >X 0ntra-tx

## Runtime Alerts
- Multisig signer changes; timelock parameter edits
- Bridge mints/burns above threshold per block/epoch
- Single-block borrow >Y0f pool TVL

## Recommended Safeguards
- Timelock + quorum + distinct signers for role/bridge ops
- Per-epoch mint quotas with rolling limits
- On-chain watcher with auto-pause on anomalies
