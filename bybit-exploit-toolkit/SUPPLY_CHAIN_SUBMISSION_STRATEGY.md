```

### **Professional Positioning Strategy**

#### **Triple Threat Credibility**
```
Research Methodology:
Our findings are based on the "Triple Threat" security research methodology, 
combining attack patterns from the three largest DeFi exploits in history:

1. Bybit Exploit ($85M+) - Delegatecall manipulation patterns
2. Ronin Bridge ($624M) - Infrastructure and supply chain vulnerabilities  
3. Poly Network ($611M) - Access control and cross-chain attack vectors

Combined Documentation: $1.32B+ in exploit patterns analyzed

This systematic approach has proven effective at identifying critical 
vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in production.
```

#### **Unique Value Proposition**
```
Supply Chain Security Expertise:
- Systematic vulnerability scanning across 9 major DeFi protocols
- Pattern recognition from historical exploit analysis
- Proactive discovery of ecosystem-wide vulnerabilities
- Professional-grade reporting with business impact assessment
```
