Professional Background:
We are security researchers specializing in systematic vulnerability discovery 
using the "Triple Threat" methodology - a systematic approach based on analysis 
of the three largest DeFi exploits in history ($1.32B+ combined losses).

Our Approach:
- Systematic vulnerability scanning across major DeFi protocols
- Pattern recognition from historical exploit analysis  
- Professional-grade reporting with business impact assessment
- Focus on ecosystem-wide vulnerabilities with high financial impact

Current Finding:
We have identified critical supply chain vulnerabilities affecting core 
JavaScript packages used throughout the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with 
potential exposure exceeding $50B across DeFi protocols and exchanges.
