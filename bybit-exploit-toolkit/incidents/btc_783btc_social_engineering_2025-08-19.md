# 783 BTC Social-Engineering Theft (2025-08-19)

- Asset: Bitcoin (BTC)
- Loss: 783 BTC (~$91M)
- Date: 2025-08-19
- Vector: Support-impersonation social engineering targeting a high-net-worth individual

## TTPs and Flow
- Impersonation of exchange/hardware wallet support; urgency + trust-building
- Victim divulged signing/keys or approved transfers; funds swept to receiver
- Peel-chain distribution followed by CoinJoin via Wasabi to obscure provenance

## IOCs
- Receiving address: `bc1qyxyk4qgyrkx4rjwsuevug04wahdk6uf95mqlej`
- Primary txid: `da598f2a941ee3c249a3c11e5e171e186a08900012f6aad26e6d11b8e8816457`

## Monitoring Plan
- Track first-hop and subsequent peel-chain outputs daily (first 5 hops)
- Flag CoinJoin entry points (Wasabi) and record timestamps
- Alert on merges into exchange-tagged clusters (potential recovery coordination)
- Tools: mempool.space, oxt.me, walletexplorer.com

## Context
- Occurs on the one-year anniversary of the $243M Genesis Creditor theft; underscores persistent social-engineering exposure in crypto

## Actions Taken
- Added IOC watchlist: `iocs/btc_783btc_theft_2025-08-19.json`
- Extended daily template with Bitcoin monitoring checklist

## Recommendations
- For programs accepting infra/ops reports: emphasize user-facing support-channel controls, anti-impersonation playbooks, and transaction hold/circuit-breakers for HNWI accounts
