### BtcTurk — $48M Multi-Chain Hot Wallet Exploit (2025-08-14)

Incident overview
- Victim: BtcTurk (CEX)
- Loss: ≈ $48M
- Vectors: Coordinated hot wallet compromise across multiple chains; rapid consolidation and swaps
- Affected networks: Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Mantle, Polygon, (plus Solana and BNB Chain indications)

Attack timeline (high-level)
1) Near-simultaneous outflows from BtcTurk hot wallets across 6–8 chains within ~30 minutes
2) Consolidation to two primary Ethereum addresses and one Solana wallet
3) Immediate DEX swaps (MetaMask Swap and DEX routers) converting diverse tokens → ETH and other highly liquid assets
4) Ongoing laundering: continued swaps, cross-chain transfers; Solana path via intermediate ("PNUT Whale") to final SOL address
5) Exchange response: halt crypto deposits/withdrawals; trading and fiat rails remained active; authorities and blockchain security firms engaged

Likely root cause (hypotheses)
- Hot wallet private key compromise or signing service breach, spanning multiple chains
- Possible compromise of internal orchestration/API with hot wallet permissions
- Insider or supply-chain vector cannot be ruled out (given simultaneous multi-chain control)

On-chain indicators (IOC/IOA)
- Rapid, multi-chain withdrawals from known exchange hot-wallet clusters
- Consolidation to a small set of EOA addresses on Ethereum; one SOL wallet created weeks prior
- Aggressive DEX swaps into ETH (and some SOL-side conversions), tolerance for slippage/fees to accelerate laundering
- Cross-chain bridging from L2s/alt-L1s toward Ethereum and Solana

Suggested real-time monitoring rules (exchange-wide)
- Rule A: Alert on velocity spikes: N outflows > X USD across ≥3 chains within T minutes from exchange-labeled wallets
- Rule B: Consolidation pattern: multiple chain sources → ≤3 destination EOAs within T; raise CRITICAL
- Rule C: Token consolidation: ≥M swaps to ETH within T from flagged EOAs; monitor DEX routers and MetaMask Swap relayers
- Rule D: Cross-chain funnel: bursts of bridge transactions from flagged EOAs; tag target bridges and L1 destinations
- Rule E: Solana path detection: watch newly created SOL accounts linked by timing/amounts from EVM flows; flag via correlation

Immediate containment guidance (CEX playbook)
- Revoke/rotate hot wallet keys per chain; pause deposits/withdrawals; isolate signing infrastructure
- Freeze known attacker EOAs with cooperating venues; distribute IOCs to partners/LEA
- Snapshot internal access logs; rotate API credentials; review CI/CD and vendor access
- Prioritize customer comms: cold storage unaffected; user balances safe; phased restoration plan

Hardening actions (post-incident)
- Adopt MPC/HSM-based per-chain hot wallet signing with quorum and velocity limits; enforce per-asset daily caps and anomaly halts
- Segregate hot wallets by asset tiers; implement withdrawal delays and address allowlists for large transfers
- Independent risk engine across chains: detect correlated outflows, consolidation, and swap patterns
- Vendor risk: least-privilege for orchestration; audited signing flows; tamper-evident logs; periodic red-team drills

Context
- Prior BtcTurk hot wallet incident (2024-06): ~$54–55M AVAX; highlights repeated exposure of hot wallet operations

Operational notes for tracking
- Maintain live dashboards for attacker EOA balances and movements; broadcast updates to counterparties for freezing
- Prepare peel-chain and mixer tracking for any Tornado/bridging patterns from attacker addresses
