# CrediX Exploit (Sonic) — August 2025

## Summary
- Type: Privilege escalation + bridge/admin abuse; flash-loan-assisted drain
- Loss: ~.5M minted/withdrawn; ~.64M flash-borrowed; bridged to Ethereum
- Root cause: Admin/Bridge roles granted via ACL/multisig compromise; unbacked collateral minted then borrowed
- Attribution: Funded via Tornado Cash → bridged to Sonic; strong inside-job suspicion (team accounts later deleted)

## Minimal Timeline
- T−6d: Attacker added as Admin and Bridge operator (ACL/multisig)
- T0: Flash loan + synthetic collateral mint + over-borrow + bridge out
- T0+hrs: Funds bridged to Ethereum; monitoring alerts fired (Cyvers/others)
- T0+1d: Team claims return; later accounts deleted; refunds not observed

## Technical Mechanics
- ACL/role change enabled Admin + Bridge role
- Bridge role enabled mint/redeem cross-chain without proper backing/limits
- Flash loan amplified borrow against fake collateral within one tx

## Indicators
- Funding: Tornado Cash → bridge to Sonic
- Behaviors: New admin signer; role updates; large bridge mints/burns; single-tx borrow spike

## Lessons for Bounty Focus
- Access control: Timelocks and multi-party verification for role changes
- Bridge authority: Roles that mint/burn wrapped assets; rate limits/quotas
- Governance: Multisig signer changes; pause/guardian; monitoring gaps
- Flash loans: Under-collateralized borrow paths; mint-then-borrow flows

## Action Items (Scanner/Monitoring)
- Scanner rules:
  - Flag addRole/setRoleAdmin callable by EOAs; RoleGranted/OwnershipTransferred without timelock
  - Detect bridge mint/burn callable by single role; unlimited/capless
  - Alert when collateral token supply jumps >X 0ntra-tx prior to borrow
- Monitoring rules:
  - Alerts for multisig signer changes; timelock param edits; large bridge mints/burns; single-block mega-borrows

## Cross-Protocol Impact
- Dependent stablecoins (e.g., scUSD) unbacked; downstream protocols paused or incurred bad debt

## Mitigations
- Timelocked, quorum-gated role changes; separate keys; rate limits on bridge mints; on-chain monitors + emergency pause
