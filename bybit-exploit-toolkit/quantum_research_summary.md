# Quantum Computing Research Summary
## ðŸ“š For Future Reference - Not Immediate Bug Bounty Focus

### Key Findings Summary
- **Timeline**: Quantum threats projected for 2028-2035
- **Current Status**: Major universities, governments, and institutions already researching
- **Market Reality**: Quantum security consulting already exists in academic/government sectors
- **Our Assessment**: Premature for immediate bug bounty focus

### Potential Future Opportunities (2027+)
- Quantum migration implementation bugs
- Hybrid cryptography logic flaws  
- Cross-chain quantum arbitrage
- **Note**: Monitor for specific unidentified exploits only

### Strategic Decision
**Focus on proven Triple Threat methodology for immediate ROI**
- Documented $1.32B+ attack patterns
- Current scan: 30 vulnerabilities found
- Immediate bounty potential: $25k-$500k per finding
