# Platform Relationship Building Strategy

## üöÄ Enhanced Credibility Positioning

### Core Value Proposition
> *"We are the only security research team with systematic analysis of the three largest DeFi exploits in history, providing complete coverage of attack vectors responsible for $1.32B+ in documented losses."*

## üéØ Platform-Specific Relationship Building

### Immunefi (Technical Excellence)

#### **Initial Introduction Strategy**
```
Subject: Introduction - Triple Threat Security Research Team

Dear Immunefi Team,

We are introducing our specialized security research team focused on DeFi vulnerabilities. Our unique approach systematically applies lessons from the three largest DeFi exploits:

- Bybit ($85M+) - Technical delegatecall and proxy vulnerabilities
- Ronin ($624M) - Infrastructure and social engineering attacks
- Poly Network ($611M) - Access control and cross-chain logic flaws

Our comprehensive analysis covers attack patterns responsible for $1.32B+ in losses, providing unmatched insight into the most critical DeFi attack vectors.

We're excited to contribute high-quality findings to the Immunefi platform and look forward to building a productive relationship.

Best regards,
Triple Threat Security Research Team
