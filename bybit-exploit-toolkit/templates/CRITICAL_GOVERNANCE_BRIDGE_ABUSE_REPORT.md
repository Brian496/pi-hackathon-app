# Critical Report Template — Governance/Bridge Role Abuse

## Executive Summary
- Vulnerability: Admin/Bridge role abuse enabling unbacked mint + cross-chain drain
- Impact: Protocol fund loss; wrapped asset insolvency; cross-chain contagion
- Severity: Critical

## Affected Components
- ACL/Role Manager
- Governance (multisig/timelock)
- Bridge mint/burn contracts
- Lending/collateral modules

## Technical Details
- Describe role(s) that can mint/burn or elevate privileges
- Show lack of timelock/quorum/rate-limits
- Show collateral mint → borrow path (intra-tx)

## Attack Path
1) Gain/abuse Admin/Bridge role
2) Mint synthetic collateral/receipts
3) Borrow real assets
4) Bridge out / redeem on L1

## Proof of Concept Checklist
- Contracts and roles enumerated
- Calls that change roles without delay
- Mint caps/limits = none; callable by single role
- Intra-tx borrow against freshly minted collateral

## Impact
- Fund loss estimate
- Insolvency of wrapped assets; downstream protocols

## Remediation
- Timelock + quorum for role changes; guardian pause
- Rate limits/quotas on bridge mints; per-epoch caps
- Separate duties: bridge, governance, collateral
- Real-time monitoring + alerts

## Severity Justification
- Unbounded fund loss; systemic cross-chain impact

## Submission Checklist
- Repro steps and tx simulations
- Affected addresses/contracts
- Screenshots/logs
- Mitigation plan
